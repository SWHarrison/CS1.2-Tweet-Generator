What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated into their own files, classes, and/or modules?

The application will randomly produce sentences comprised of words randomly sampled from a corpus text


Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too much contextual knowledge?

They could understand what the program does by the names and comments.


What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use case? If there are global variables, why are they needed?

There are no global variables.


Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects as possible?

There are no global variables to change nor do any functions mutate data, they are all "pure" functions.


Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object-Oriented Programming style by defining them as methods of a class?

Outside of the listogram/dictogram change, every function created so far would become a method of these classes.


Can files be used as both modules and as scripts?

Yes, they contain the line ` if __name__ == "__main__": ` allowing it to run as scripts


Do modules all depend on each other or can they be used independently?

Modules can function separately but they require specific data to function, that is most easily obtained from the other modules.
